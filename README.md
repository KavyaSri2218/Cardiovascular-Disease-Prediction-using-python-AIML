# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-using-python-AIML

Cardiovascular Disease Prediction 🫀
📌 Project Overview

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for 28.1% of fatalities in India and 17.6 million deaths globally in 2016. Early prediction and diagnosis of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely treatment and lifestyle adjustments.

This project focuses on building a machine learning-based predictive system that analyzes medical data and predicts the likelihood of heart disease with high accuracy. By applying different ML algorithms, we aim to determine the most effective model for reliable and precise heart disease detection.

🚀 Project Objectives

Data Pre-processing: Clean and transform the dataset for effective model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, patterns, and relationships among features.

Feature Correlation Analysis: Generate and analyze the correlation matrix to identify key factors influencing heart disease.

Model Implementation: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

Decision Trees (DT)

Logistic Regression (LR)

Random Forest (RF)

Model Evaluation: Compare accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of different models.

Final Model Selection: Deploy the best-performing model for heart disease prediction.
